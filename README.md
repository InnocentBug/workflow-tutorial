This is a tutorial repository that demonstrates how to set up a GitHub workflow for two independent projects, one in Python and the other in C++.

## C++ Project

The C++ project is located in the [`src`](src/) directory. The project uses CMake for building, and tests are included via CMake as well.

You can check the workflow file for this project at [`.github/workflows/test_cpp.yml`](.github/workflows/test_cpp.yml).

## Python Project

The Python project is located in [`magic_python`](magic_python/) and is fully set up as a module. Tests are run using `pytest`.

You can check the workflow file for this project at [`.github/workflows/test_python.yml`](.github/workflows/test_python.yml).

## Trunk

We use [trunk.io](https://trunk.io) to manage formatting and software engineering. It is free for open-source projects; please refer to their website for more details.

You can check the workflow file for this project at [`.github/workflows/trunk.yml`](.github/workflows/trunk.yml). This workflow ensures that everything is up to standard.

## Notes

Extra notes for the process are included below. These can be ignored.

1. Create a repository, set it to public, apply MIT license, add a Python gitignore, and clone it.
2. Protect the `main` branch via `Settings > Branches > Add Protection Rule`. The settings should include requiring a PR, requiring approvals (optional), dismissing stale pull request reviews, requiring status checks, and requiring the branch to be up-to-date.
3. Add labels to PR, assign yourself to PR, squash and merge PR.
4. Add the C++ program, but not the test. Push and open a PR.
5. Add a simple workflow to test.
6. Add CMake to build and test.
7. Create badges via `Actions > workflow name > [...] > create status badge > add text`.
